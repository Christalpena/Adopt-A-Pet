This is a web page created with python and it's framework Djaango, there you will be aable to look for many race of dogs and cats and if you find one that likes you you will can adopt she or he throught a form.
There are many forms, some of them will send a gmail to the person how is managing this page and others will be saved in the database.
if you are the one how is managing this web page, you will be able to add pets, services and also delete them. You will also be able to see the images of the animals from the admin panel without having to refresh the page to see them.
This looks like a simple page, but the magic is in the models and relationships between tables that this project has.
